```{r}
team_results <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-03-26/team-results.csv')
public_picks <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-03-26/public-picks.csv')

Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

2. Joining Tables
3. Groupby and Summary
